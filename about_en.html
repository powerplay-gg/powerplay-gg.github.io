              time to testing new features before giving them to development.

          <p class="bold-26">Backstory</p>
          <p class="regular-20">
            In 2019, I have been working in sales for five years. I realized
            that I was standing in one place and I needed to change a
            profession. I chose the IT, because it is a endless movement,
            development and technology. Design turned out to be the closest
            direction to me. At first I studied everything on my own, then I
            went to the WDI school courses, got into a product company and began
            my professional path in design.
          </p>

        <div class="card-text-gap16">
          <p class="bold-26">Loginet</p>
          <p class="regular-20">
            In almost two years of work at Loginet, I redesigned more than 10
            services, designed 5 new services, made a new admin panel, rebuilt
            and structured a style guide, rewrote half of the design guidlines.
            After my manager left, I had to take the managment into my own
            hands, hired employees, built key processes within the department
            (sprints, 1:1, design debt, guidelines), began to join product
            development discussions with CTO, PO and founders. We also managed
            to convince the founders of the need for CJM (we made it together
            with the team and began to close the pains that it highlighted). It
            turned out to shift the company to a data-driven approach in design
            and start changing the processes of product creation. For example,
            now developers are connecting an analytics system for the portal;
            when developing complex services, the roadmap includes time for
            testing design before being transferred to development.

          <p class="regular-20">
            At the time of the portfolio update, I have been working at YouDo
            for six months, during which time I managed to update the old design
            system, make its new structure and at the moment we are matching it
            with frontend developers in order to work with the same components.
            I Also reworked the layout structure, about 50% of the work is done.
            Previously, the company had one figma file per task, which is
            inconvenient because it is not clear where the current design is, it
            cannot be seen in its entirety, and no one will update old files. I
            also managed to design the personal account of the employee, before
            the employee interacted with the platform via WhatsApp, now there is
            a full-fledged personal account on the web.
