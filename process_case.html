              In May 2021, my teamlead quit and I started working alone. For two
              months we could not find either a new leader or a middle designer.
              Realizing that it was impossible to continue working like this, I
              initiated the hiring of a junior designers. Having hired two
              juniors, I realized that a number of new processes needed to be
              introduced.

              <p class="regular-20">
                Previously, we worked without tasks and sprints, the situation
                allowed. After hiring two new designers and increasing the
                number of projects, I introduced sprint work with task tracking.
                At the beginning of each week, we called the PO and synchronized
                the tasks: what was done and what needs to be done, determined
                the pool of tasks for the week.

              <p class="regular-20">
                For better adaptation and growth of employees, I started holding
                weekly 1:1 meetings, where we discuss the past week with the
                designer, what tasks were completed, where there were problems,
                we determine growth points and make a plan for the next week.

                Over the 2 years of the existence of a new design of the
                product, many problems have accumulated in the technical
                implementation of the intended design. Given the intensity of
                the growth in the number and complexity of projects, in the near
                future we could face either a deterioration in the quality of
                design, or an increase in development time. I compiled a list of
                problems, such as inaccuracies in layouts, outdated approaches
                to interface design, usability issues, etc. All these problems
                are framed in tasks and distributed in sprints.

                Our product grew and without clearly defined rules, the design
                could not exist. We defined them with my previous teamlead, but
                there was no unified knowledge base and description of the
                operation of the elements and patterns of user interaction. The
                guidelines helped new employees to quickly adapt to the company,
                simplified the interaction between departments and reduced the
                number of calls to designers. In November 2021, we presented the
                structure of our guidelines and a description of several
                elements of the team.
